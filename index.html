<p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.</p>

<h2 id="stand-alone-projects">Stand-alone projects.</h2>

<h3 id="handwritten-digit-recognition">Handwritten digit recognition</h3>

<p>This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site (also works on mobile) where user can draw a digit, and machine learning models (FNN and CNN) will try to recognize it. After than models can use the drawn digit for training to improve their accuracy. Live version is <a href="https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/digit-draw-recognize">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="predicting-how-points-end-in-tennis">From AI to AO: Predicting How Points End in Tennis</h3>
      
<p>Predicting How Points End in Tennis was a competition hosted on CrowdAnalytix. Since this was my first official data science competition, I spent a lot of time learning and exploring different algorithms to get a feel about how each algorithm worked. The goal of the compeittion was: given certain features about how a point developed (such as how fast the last shot was or how far the players was away from the net), the goal was to predict how the point ended: winner, unforced error, or forced error. The model I settled on was XGBoost, which is a super popular algorithm among Kagglers. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ml874/Predicting-How-Points-End-in-Tennis/blob/master/Gradient%20Boosting.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
