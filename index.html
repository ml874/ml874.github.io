<p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.</p>

<h2 id="stand-alone-projects">Stand-alone projects.</h2>

<h3 id="handwritten-digit-recognition">Handwritten digit recognition</h3>

<p>This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site (also works on mobile) where user can draw a digit, and machine learning models (FNN and CNN) will try to recognize it. After than models can use the drawn digit for training to improve their accuracy. Live version is <a href="https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/digit-draw-recognize">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster">Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb">Github</a> <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb">nbviewer</a></p>

<p>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Kaggle</a>.
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.</p>

<h3 id="ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo">Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts… Boo!</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb">Github</a> <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb">nbviewer</a></p>

<p>Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts… Boo! is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo">Kaggle</a>.
This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="otto-group-product-classification-challenge">Otto Group Product Classification Challenge</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb">Github</a> <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb">nbviewer</a></p>

<p>Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict their category. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge">Kaggle</a>.
The data is obfuscated, so the main questionlies in the selection of the model for prediction.</p>

<h3 id="imbalanced-classes">Imbalanced classes</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb">Github</a> <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb">nbviewer</a></p>

<p>In real world it is common to meet data in which some classes are more common and others are rarer. In case of a serious disbalance prediction rare classes could be difficult using standard classification methods. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can’t share the data, used in this analysis.</p>

<h3 id="bank-card-activations">Bank card activations</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb">Github</a> <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb">nbviewer</a></p>

<p>Banks strive to increase the efficiency of their contacts with customers. One of the areas which require this is offering new products to existing clients (cross-selling). Instead of offering new products to all clients, it is a good idea to predict the probability of a positive response. Then the offers could be sent to those clients, for whom the probability of response is higher than some threshold value.
In this notebook I try to solve this problem.</p>
