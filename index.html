<p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis and exploration/application of machine 
  learning algorithms. Other projects will fall under Miscellaneous.</p>

<h3 id="predicting-how-points-end-in-tennis">From AI to AO: Predicting How Points End in Tennis</h3>
      
<p>Predicting How Points End in Tennis was a competition hosted on CrowdAnalytix. 
  Since this was my first data science competition, I spent a lot of time learning and exploring different 
  algorithms to get a feel about how each algorithm worked. The goal of the compeittion was to predict how the point ended: 
  winner, unforced error, or forced error. The model I settled on was XGBoost, which is the go-to algorithm among Kagglers.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-learning-blackjack">Reinforcement Learning- Blackjack</h3>

<p> I am a huge fan of Ed Thorp. So it shouldn't surprise you that I enjoy games that require a blend of skill and luck: 
  blackjack, poker, trading, etc... After spending a good portion of my summer (during the commute to my internship) practicing
  counting cards and various blackjack strategies, I wondered if a machine could learn to play blackjack optimally. Although I 
  did not discover blackjack's holy grail, I did learn a lot about Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Q-learning, and approximating 
  the Q-value using neural networks.
  
  The code can be found
