<p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis and exploration/application of machine learning algorithms. Other projects will fall under Miscellaneous.</p>

<h3 id="predicting-how-points-end-in-tennis">From AI to AO: Predicting How Points End in Tennis</h3>
      
<p>Predicting How Points End in Tennis was a competition hosted on CrowdAnalytix. This was also my first data science competition, so I spent a lot of time learning and exploring different algorithms to get a feel about how each algorithm worked. The goal of the compeittion was to predict how the point ended: winner, unforced error, or forced error. The model I settled on was XGBoost, which is the go-to algorithm among Kagglers.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-learning-blackjack">Reinforcement Learning- Blackjack</h3>

<p> I am a huge fan of Ed Thorp. So it shouldn't surprise you that I enjoy games that require a blend of skill and luck: blackjack, poker, trading, etc... After spending a good portion of my summer (during the commute to my internship) practicing counting cards and various blackjack strategies, I wondered if a machine could learn to play blackjack optimally. Although I did not discover blackjack's holy grail, I did learn a lot about Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Q-learning, and approximating the Q-value using neural networks.
  
The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ml874/Blackjack--Reinforcement-Learning">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notebook-of-things">Notebook Of Things I Don't Know About</h3>
<p> An idea pioneeered by Richard Feynman, the famous American theoretical physicist. As an undergrad, Feynman collected a notebook which he called the "NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DONâ€™T KNOW ABOUT". From his biographer James Gleick, "For the first but  not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject." </p>
<p> So here is my own notebook relating to Machine Learning/Data Science and potentially various other topics. </p>
